# Changelog

## POE part 2:
-This part of the poe is for the coding of the app
-I built this app using React and TypeScript with TailwindCSS for clean, responsive design. It starts with an animated splash screen that loads into a smooth, motion-based home interface. The menu is fully dynamic, showing starters, mains, desserts, and drinks in tabs. I created a custom hook to let the chef add, edit, or delete dishes, with data saved in local storage. The consistent amber-orange theme and animations give it a polished, professional feel.”
